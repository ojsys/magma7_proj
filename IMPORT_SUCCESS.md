## Notes About the Import

### Foreign Key Handling
A temporary admin user (ID: 1) was created to satisfy foreign key constraints in the MediaAsset model. This is the same user you'll use for admin access.

### Images
Images are referenced by URL, not uploaded files. They point to:
- Production URLs: `https://magma7fitness.com/media/...`
- External URLs: Unsplash, etc.

Images will load from these URLs when you view the site locally.

### What Was NOT Imported
The following were intentionally excluded for security:
- Production user accounts
- Subscriptions and payments
- Session data
- Error logs

This is a clean development database with only content data.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Loading
If images don't load, they may be pointing to production URLs that require authentication. You can:
1. Download media files from production
2. Place them in `media/` folder locally
3. Or keep using production URLs

### Database Backup
A backup was automatically created:
```
db.sqlite3.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
```

To restore from backup:
```bash
cp db.sqlite3.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS db.sqlite3
```

### Re-import Fresh Data
To import fresh data from production again:
```bash
# Download new production_data.json from cPanel
bash import_production_now.sh
```

---

The following helper scripts are now available:

1. **`import_production_safe.sh`** - Interactive import with prompts
2. **`import_production_now.sh`** - Auto-import (no prompts)
3. **`export_production_data.sh`** - For use on production server
